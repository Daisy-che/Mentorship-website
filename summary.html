            The first two chapters of Trevor Noah’s “Born a Crime” talks about Trevor Noah’s journey. The racial injustices and how there was inequality in South Africa. He talks about the Immorality Act of 1927, a South African law that criminalized sexual relationships between whites and people of color. These set the stage for the exploration of racial tensions, discrimination, and the impact of apartheid on individuals and families. Patricia, Noah's mum ran away from home to live and work in Johannesburg. She had to hide because she could not trust anyone and it was illegal for Black people to live in the city. Noah was “a mixed child” and had to hide most of the time so as not to be seen and this affected his relationship with his father. He talks about his home country’s history, culture, and traditions.
            Noah's journey is a narrative of racial injustice and the struggle for equality in South Africa. Trevor’s mother was a devout Christian who took her family to multiple churches every Sunday.

            Before apartheid separated South Africa’s people by color, Black South Africans were divided into tribes. These tribes had a long history of conflict, with the Zulu and the Xhosa. Xhosa women were seen as prostitutes and when Noah was traveling with his mom, a bus driver criticized her for traveling with children without a man late at night.

            In Kericho county, tribalism is a main challenge as one tribe is favored. A certain tribe gets it easy with jobs and even resources while others are left behind. These highly contribute to there being classes of those who are poor and rich. Single mothers are mostly judged in society for not having a man and are viewed as immoral in the society.

            Insecurity is a day-to-day issue addressed as many people do not have a source of income and they revolt against stealing. Matatu and Uber drivers are at times involved in crimes and attack their passengers. The matatu’s drivers fight over customers and they use vulgar language addressing each other.
