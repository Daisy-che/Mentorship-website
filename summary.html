        <h1>Book:Born a Crime</h1>
        <h1>Author:Trevor Noah</h1>
        <p>
            The first two chapters of Trevor Noah’s “Born a Crime” talks about Trevor Noah’s journey. <br>The racial injustices and how there was inequality in South Africa. <br>He talks about the Immorality Act of 1927, a South African law that criminalized sexual relationships<br> between whites and people of color. These set the stage for the exploration of racial tensions, discrimination, <br>and the impact of apartheid on individuals and families. Patricia, Noah's mum ran away<br> from home to live and work in Johannesburg. She had to hide because she could not trust anyone<br> and it was illegal for Black people to live in the city. Noah was “a mixed child” <br>and had to hide most of the time so as not to be seen and this affected his relationship with his father. <br>He talks about his home country’s history, culture, and traditions.
Noah's journey is a narrative of racial injustice and the struggle <br>for equality in South Africa. Trevor’s mother was a devout<br> Christian who took her family to multiple churches every Sunday.
Before apartheid separated South Africa’s people by color, Black <br>South Africans were divided into tribes. These tribes had a long history of conflict, <br>with the Zulu and the Xhosa. Xhosa women were seen as prostitutes and when Noah was traveling with his mom,<br> a bus driver criticized her for traveling with children without a man late at night.
<br>In Kericho county, tribalism is a main challenge as one tribe is favored.<br> A certain tribe gets it easy with jobs and even resources while others<br> are left behind. These highly contribute to there being classes of those who are poor and rich.<br> Single mothers are mostly judged in society for not having a man<br> and are viewed as immoral in the society.
In society, women are religious. You will find that apart <br>from going to church on Sundays, women have fellowships, women’s day, <br>and meetings in between the week. They are the backbone of Christianity in their households <br>and ensure their children go to church. Most of the time they move from one church to another.<br> They believe that Each church offers something different.
Insecurity is a day-to-day issue addressed as many people<br> do not have a source of income and they revolt against stealing.<br> Matatu and Uber drivers are at times involved in crimes and attack their passengers. <br>The matatu’s drivers fight over customers and they use vulgar language addressing each other.
